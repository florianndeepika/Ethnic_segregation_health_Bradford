**Background:** Ethnic segregation is predominantly increasing around the world. The proportion of a particular ethnic group living in an area can have an impact on various social economic factors, especially in health outcomes. The study focuses on the city of Bradford in the United Kingdom, which has a high level of ethnic diversity and segregation, and it is being associated with society's health outcomes, including general health and disability.

  Ethnic minority groups often face higher levels of segregation than the majority population, which may contribute to health disparities. This study will focus on one of the measures of segregation - Index of Dissimilarity to identify how Bradford stands outs from the other cities in the United Kingdom in terms of ethnic segregation and how the ethnic segregation has evolved for the past 3 decades in Bradford. The study also extends to explore and analyze health outcomes with respect to each ethnic groups.
 
**Methods:** Firstly, Bradford geo-spatial data was used to plot the ethnic segregation to better understand residential segregation. Secondly, Index of dissimilarity was computed for the past 3 decades with UK census data to identify the pattern of residential segregation. In addition, K-means and Hierarchal clustering analysis was computed to identify clusters in the 2021 health data. Finally, the geo-spatial data was used to map the clustering results in Bradford to identify areas having positive effects and negative effects on health outcomes for various ethnic minority groups. Python programming language was used for data and statistical analysis and Tableau was used to map the clusters in Bradford.

 **Findings:** Overall, the paper highlights the magnitude of residential segregation in Bradford and the need for policy makers to intervene and promote diversity in neighborhoods. Though there is no direct correlation identified between index of dissimilarity and health outcomes, few pockets of ethnic clusters and their health outcomes could be improved by policy interventions.

**Conclusion:** The statistical study of residential segregation trend over the decades and the machine learning clustering analysis provides comprehensive insights and awareness about the extent of ethnic segregation and its impact on health outcomes to both the residents and the policy makers to take steps in the right direction for the betterment of the society.
